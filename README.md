# 🧠 Deep Learning ANN - Customer Churn Prediction

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using **TensorFlow and Keras** to predict **customer churn** based on demographic and account-related data.  
It includes a complete workflow — from model training and evaluation to deployment on **Streamlit Cloud**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to leave a service.  
By analyzing patterns in customer data, companies can take proactive steps to retain them.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning lifecycle**:
1. Data preprocessing  
2. Feature encoding and scaling  
3. ANN model design and training  
4. Model evaluation  
5. Deployment via Streamlit

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The ANN consists of:

- Input layer (11 features after encoding)

- Two hidden layers with ReLU activation

- Output layer with sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Loss: Binary Crossentropy
  - Metric: Accuracy

## 📊 Dataset Details
**File: Churn_Modelling.csv**
### Contains customer information from a bank, including:

- Feature	Description
- CreditScore: Customer credit score
- Geography: Country
- Gender: Male/Female
- Age: Customer’s age
- Tenure: Number of years with the bank
- Balance: Account balance
- NumOfProducts: Number of bank products
- HasCrCard: Credit card holder (1 = Yes)
- IsActiveMember: Active membership (1 = Yes)
- EstimatedSalary: Salary estimate
- Exited: Target variable (1 = Churned)
## 📈 Model Accuracy

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained for **100 epochs** with the following performance:

| Metric | Training | Validation |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Final Accuracy** | **86.7%** | **86.3%** |
| **Final Loss** | **0.32** | **0.34** |

🧠 The model shows good generalization, as training and validation accuracies are close — indicating minimal overfitting.
